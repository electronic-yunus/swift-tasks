# TASK 8

1. Create a Shape base class and derive from it Circle, Square and Rectangle. Shape should have two methods area() -> Float and perimeter() -> Float that both return 0. Implement the methods and add the necessary properties on Circle, Square and Rectangle.

2. Create the same classes from the first exercise, but this time make Shape a protocol.

3. Create a custom initializer for Circle, Square and Rectangle and create two instance of each one.

4. Add the instance created in the exercise above into an array shapes and use polymorphism to find out the total area and perimeter of the shapes.

5. Solve the exercise above using map and reduce. Implement your map and reduce with one loop.

6. Implement a __matrix__ structure with generics.

7. Implement a __chessboard__ class.
