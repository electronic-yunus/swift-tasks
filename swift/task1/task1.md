# TASK1
1.  Determine the number of seconds in a year and store the number in a variable named __secondInAYear__.
2. Your are given the width and height of a screen in pixels. Calculate the total number of pixels on the screen and store the result in a variable named __numberOfPixels__.

### EXAMPLE
 INPUT:
```swift
	var widthOfScreen = 600
	var heightOfScreen = 300
```
 RESULT:
```swift
	numberOfPixels = 180000
```

3. You are given the sum and the difference of two numbers. Find out the values of the original numbers and store them in variables __a__ and __b__. Hint: You can freely choose the sum and the difference, and store them in variables.

### EXAMPLE
 INPUT:
```swift
	var sum = 8
	var difference = 4
```
 RESULT:
```swift
	a = 6
	b = 2
```

4. Given two variables __a__ and __b__, swap their values. That is the new value of __a __will become the old value of __b__ and vice versa.
   > Try to solve this task in two different ways. 
5. You are given a number __a__. Print the last digit of __a__. Hint: Again, you can choose any number of __a__, but make sure to return the last digit.
6. A class consists of __numberOfBoys__ boys and __numberOfGirls__ girls.
   Print the percentage of boys in the class followed by the percentage of girls in the class.
   The percentage should be printed rounded down to the nearest integer. For example **33.333333333333** will be printed as **33**.
7. __Raindrops__
	Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.
	* If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
	* If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
	* If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
	* If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just output the number itself.
	__*Examples*__
	* 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
	* In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong". Because we have 7 as a factor. 
	* 30's factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.
	* In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang". Because we have 3 and 5 as factors.
	* 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
	* In raindrop-speak, this would be "34". Because there are no factors we need. 
	
	Hint: As you might have guessed, you should find the factors first.
